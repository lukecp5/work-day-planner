# Work-Day-Planner


## Introduction
This app is designed to be a way for busy people to plan out their day. It features the current date at the top of the page, and a timeblock for each hour of a normal business day. By clicking a timeblock, you can enter your event/task for that time of day. By clicking the save button next to the respective timeblock, you can save your entry to your local storage for later use. It will be available to you when you return to the page - even after navigating away from the application.
